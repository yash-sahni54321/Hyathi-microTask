## Microservice Description

This microservice task leverages the power of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the relational database management system for storing and managing data. PostgreSQL is known for its robustness, extensibility, and performance, making it an excellent choice for handling structured data in our application.

Additionally, we have integrated the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework into this microservice. Prisma simplifies database interactions, streamlines query building, and provides a type-safe and intuitive way to work with databases. With Prisma, we can efficiently model our database schema, perform database operations, and ensure data integrity.

The combination of PostgreSQL and Prisma enables us to build a highly reliable and scalable microservice, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval while maintaining code quality and development speed.
